# hl7_data_viz
HL7 data visualisation

This simple Python project does does some data processing on a source file
to extract nodes and edges files usable by Gephi (and probably similar tools).

The output files are all designed as 2-mode graphs, as described in http://www.martingrandjean.ch/gephi-introduction/[this
Gephi tutorial^].

The results in Gephi are visible by using the saved .gephi projects, with some
visualisations saved as screen captures in the gephi directory.
